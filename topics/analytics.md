Schedules collects anonymous analytics though the open-source analytics platform [Umami](https://umami.is/). No personally-identifiable information is ever stored on our servers.

Umami's goal is to provide privacy-focused analytics. Umami does not collect any personally identifiable information and anonymizes all data collected.

In the future, the Umami dashboard will be open to all, but right now, it is restricted to the development team only.

Data collected by Umami includes:
- Pages visited
- The referrer (where you came from)
- What time Schedules was accessed
- The browser
- The operating system
  - This does not include the specific version number, in other words, it only says "macOS", "Windows 10", etc.
- The type of device (mobile, desktop, laptop)
- The country you are accessing Schedules from
