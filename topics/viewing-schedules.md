To view a schedule, go to the homepage of Schedules and select one of the schedules.

On the schedule page, underneath the schedule name is the current day and time. To the right of that, is the button to view the timetable and edit settings. Underneath the header, there are two cards. The first is the current period and time remaining. The second is the next period and when it starts (this is only shown if there is a next period).

If the schedule is on a break, a single card will be displayed that says the break name.
